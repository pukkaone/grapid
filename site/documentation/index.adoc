*Version {revnumber}*

Grapid is an opinionated, schema-first framework for implementing GraphQL servers in Java.
While the framework prescribes where you put GraphQL schema definition files and Java classes, you
only need to implement the business logic for your API.
The framework translates GraphQL schemas to the code necessary for processing GraphQL requests,
such as converting between GraphQL types and Java types.
