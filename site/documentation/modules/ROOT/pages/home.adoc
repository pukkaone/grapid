= Grapid
:page-layout: home

Grapid is an opinionated, schema-first framework for implementing GraphQL servers in Java.
While the framework prescribes where you put GraphQL schema definition files and Java classes, you
only need to implement the business logic for your API.
The framework generates the code to wire GraphQL requests to your business logic.


== How It Works

=== 1. Define GraphQL schema
[source,graphql]
----
type Query {
  greet(name: String!): String!
}
----

=== 2. Write Java application code
[source,java]
----
@Component
public class QueryResolver {
  public String greet(String name) {
    return "Hello " + name;
  }
}
----

=== 3. Build and run
[source,sh]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----
